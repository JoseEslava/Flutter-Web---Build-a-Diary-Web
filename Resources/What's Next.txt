What's Next
Well, you made it to the end of this course!

Congratulations!  I hope you enjoyed learning about building Flutter web full-fledged web app from scratch.

So, what's next?  Well, now that you have the skills under your belt, I would encourage you to build more web apps using Flutter. Yes, that's right - keep practicing your skills!

Here are a few places you could go to learn more and get a bit more inspired:

1. https://flutter.dev - your flutter dev documentation where you should always check out!

2. https://flutter.gskinner.com/folio/ - this is an entire Flutter web app built using the same tools you've used in this course!



If you build something, please don't forget to share it with us too! You can create a thread in this course and show off your project - you've earned the right.



Thank you, and I hope you keep coding, always.
